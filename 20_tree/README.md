# Tree

A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges.

### Node
A node is an entity that contains a key or alue and pointers to its child nodes. The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or external nodes that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes. The node having at least a child node is called an internal node.

### Edge
It is the link between any two nodes.

### Root
It is the topmost node of a tree

### Height of a node
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest lead.

### Depth of the node
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node

### Height of a tree
The height of a tree is the height of the root node or the depth of the deepest node

### Degree of a node
Is the total number of branches of that node

### Forest
A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

# Binary tree

A binary tree is a tre data structure in which each parent node can have at most two children. Each node of a binary tree consists of three items:
- Data item
- Address of left child
- Address of right child
