# Graphs

A graphs consists of a set of nodes or vertices together with a set of edges or arcs where each edge joins two vertices, a graph is undirected, each edge is an unordered pair or vertices, and we don't regard either of the two vertices as having a distinct role from the other.

## Why graphs are useful

Graphs can be used to model any situation where we have things that are related to each other in pairs, all of the following can be represented by graphs.

- Family trees: Nodes are members, with an edge from each parent to each of their children.
- Transportation networks: Nodes are airports, intersections, ports, etc. Edges are airline flights, oneway road, shipping routes.
