# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last in First Out) approach to perform a series of basic operations like push, pop, peek, and traverse. A stack can be implemented using an array or linked list.

A stack is an asbtract linear data structure serving as a collection of elements that are inserted and removed according to the LIFO (Last In First Out) approach, insertions and deletion happen on the same end (top) in a stack. The top of the stack is returned using the peek operation.

## What is the stack data structure in C?
In C, the stack data structure is an ordered, linear sequence of items. It is a LIFO data structure, which means that we can insert or remove an item at the top of the stack only. It is sequential data type, unlike an array, we can only access the top most element in a stack.
