# typedef

The C programming language provides a keyword called `typedef`, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte numbers.

```c
typedef unsigned char BYTE;
BYTE b1, b2;
```
After this type definition, the indentifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char.
